## 📘 Research Support

As part of my academic and mentoring responsibilities, I have provided guidance and methodological support for various research projects and theses, including:

- **🎓 Personal Master's Thesis**: _Credit Risk Management of Corporate Loans in Senegal (UGB)_  
  ➤ Estimated corporate credit risk using a binomial logit model and developed data-driven recommendations.

- **📘 Supervised Theses (UGB)**  
  - _Impact of COVID-19 on Bank Credit_: Regression-based analysis using OLS.  
  - _External Debt and Economic Growth_: Econometric modeling of debt-growth dynamics.

- **🌊 Environmental Economics**: _Estimation of bycatch of sea turtles and seabirds_  
  ➤ Guided empirical analysis using logit models and supported final reporting.

- **📡 Telecom Sector Support**:  
  - _Customer Retention in Sonatel's Fiber Services_: Strategic and data-driven recommendations based on SWOT & PESTEL.  
  - _Customer Churn Analysis_: Applied the C5.0 algorithm for churn prediction and provided methodological advice.

- **🚨 Customs Fraud Detection (UGB)**:  
  ➤ Supervised an OLS-based predictive model to detect customs declaration fraud.

- **📊 Independent Research**:  
  _Comparative Analysis of Poverty (Senegal 2006 & 2011)_ using binomial and multinomial logit models to explore the determinants of subjective vs. monetary poverty.

These research activities reflect my commitment to capacity building, econometric modeling, and evidence-based policy guidance.
